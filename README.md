# Superconductor-Critical-Temperature-Prediction

The purpose of this notebook is to predict the superconducting critical temperature, ùëáùëê, of a material given the
elemental makeup and/or various physical properties.

Note: The machine learning model in this notebook does not predict the existence of superconductivity in a material.

Usefulness: This machine learning model would indicate what temperature range to search for initial measurements
of a proposed superconductor. The model would also be useful as part of a process for designing superconducting
materials for custom applications.
